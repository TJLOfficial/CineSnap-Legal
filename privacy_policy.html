    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: 25.2.2026</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how CineSnap ("we", "us", or "our") handles your data when you use our mobile
        application.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.</strong></p>
    <p>CineSnap operates entirely <strong>locally on your device</strong>. When you select a video to extract frames:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The video file is processed directly on your phone's processor.</li>
        <li>The extracted images are saved directly to your phone's internal storage (Gallery).</li>
        <li>No video or image data is ever sent to any external server or cloud service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requires the following permissions to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Read Media/Storage:</strong> To allow you to select videos from your gallery.</li>
        <li><strong>Write Storage:</strong> To save the extracted images to your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used strictly for the app's core functionality.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services (Advertising)</h2>
    <p>The free version of CineSnap displays advertisements provided by <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob may collect
        certain information to serve personalized or non-personalized ads, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers (such as Advertising ID)</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>General location data</li>
        <li>App usage data for ad performance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information on how Google handles your data, please review the <a
            href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Premium users do not see any ads</strong>, and no ad-related data is collected for them.</p>

    <h2>5. AI Enhancer Feature (Transparency & Processing)</h2>
    <p>The Premium "AI Enhance" feature utilizes TensorFlow Lite to process images directly on your device's hardware.
        This means the AI enhancement operates 100% offline and no images are sent to any external servers. This feature
        is intended for image upscaling and restoration. Please note that performance and compatibility of the AI
        features depend heavily on your device's hardware capabilities.</p>

    <h2>6. User Rights (GDPR & CCPA)</h2>
    <p>Under applicable data protection laws, including the GDPR, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase your
        data, as well as the right to restrict or object to its processing. Because CineSnap processes all user media
        entirely locally on-device, we do not have access to your personal files to delete or modify them on your
        behalf. To withdraw consent for personalized advertising data collected by Google AdMob (Free Version), you can
        adjust your advertising preferences directly within your Android device settings (Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads
        &gt; Delete advertising ID or Opt out of Ads Personalization).</p>
